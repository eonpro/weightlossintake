# Weight Loss Intake Platform - Enterprise Upgrade

## Background and Motivation

This is a **medical intake questionnaire web application** for **EONMeds/EONPro**, a telehealth platform specializing in GLP-1 weight loss medications. The application is being upgraded to enterprise-grade architecture.

### Purpose
- Collect patient demographics and contact information
- Screen for medical eligibility (BMI, medical conditions, contraindications)
- Gather medical history for licensed physician review
- Qualify patients before redirecting to checkout/payment platform
- Support bilingual experience (English/Spanish)

## Safe Cleanup Actions

### ✅ SAFE TO REMOVE (No Impact on V1)
1. `page-backup.tsx` - Duplicate backup file
2. Unused npm packages (can reinstall if needed for V2)
3. Console.log statements (use conditional logging)

### ⚠️ KEEP FOR NOW (V2 Future Use)
1. `@/types/form.ts` - Will use when V2 goes live
2. `@/validation/schemas.ts` - Will use when V2 goes live
3. `@/store/intakeStore.ts` - Will use when V2 goes live
4. `@/config/forms/` - Will use when V2 goes live
5. `@/components/form-engine/` - Will use when V2 goes live

### ⚠️ REVIEW FOR PRODUCTION
1. `debug/page.tsx` - Remove or add auth gate
2. `api/airtable/test/route.ts` - Remove or add auth gate

---

## Project Status Board

### Production (V1)
- ✅ All intake pages working
- ✅ Airtable integration functional
- ✅ BMI calculation fixed
- ✅ Bilingual support active
- ✅ Mobile responsive

### Development (V2)
- ✅ Types defined
- ✅ Store created
- ✅ Validation schemas ready
- ⚠️ Only ~15 of 60+ steps configured
- ⚠️ Not connected to Airtable
- ⚠️ Not deployed

---

## Lessons

1. **Zustand persist middleware** - Use `partialize` to exclude actions from storage
2. **Configuration pattern** - Separate data from presentation completely
3. **Conditional navigation** - Array of rules with operator-based matching
4. **BMI Bug** - Always parseInt() height values from sessionStorage (strings!)
5. **Lottie Libraries** - iframe embeds work better than React libraries for simple use
6. **Unused dependencies** - Installed for V2 but V1 still in production

## SOAP Note PDF Generation Plan (January 4, 2026)

### Background & Motivation

Need to generate a **second PDF document** (SOAP Note) alongside the existing Intake Form PDF. This SOAP note is a medical document that:
- Uses the same patient data collected during intake
- Follows a standardized SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) format
- Includes provider attestation with electronic signature
- Gets uploaded to IntakeQ patient profile

### Key Requirements

1. **Same Data Source** - Uses all data from intake form (name, DOB, sex, height, weight, BMI, medical history, etc.)
2. **SOAP Format** - Structured medical document with S/O/A/P sections
3. **Provider Signature** - Include image: `https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c49a9b_4dc4d9fce65f4c2a94047782401ffe9a~mv2.png`
4. **Same UI Style** - Match the existing intake form PDF styling (Poppins font, green accents, section boxes)
5. **PDF.co Generation** - Use same API as intake form
6. **IntakeQ Upload** - Upload to "SOAP NOTES" folder on patient profile

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: SOAP HTML Template
| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Create `generateSoapNoteHtml()` | Function that builds HTML from patient data |
| Map intake fields to SOAP sections | Correctly place data in S/O/A/P format |
| Style matching intake form | Same CSS, fonts, colors |
| Add provider signature image | Embed in Provider Attestation section |

#### Phase 2: Airtable Script Integration
| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Add SOAP PDF generation | After intake PDF, generate SOAP PDF |
| Upload to IntakeQ | Second upload call to "SOAP NOTES" folder |
| Update Airtable status | Track both PDFs |

### SOAP Note Data Mapping

| SOAP Section | Source Data Fields |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Patient Info** | firstName, lastName, DOB, sex, state |
| **S - Subjective** | GLP-1 history, goals, activity level, symptoms |
| **O - Objective** | Height, weight, BMI, blood pressure, medical history, medications, allergies |
| **A - Assessment** | BMI classification, contraindications check, medical necessity |
| **P - Plan** | Medication recommendation based on GLP-1 type preference |
| **Provider** | Static provider info + signature image |

### BMI Classification Logic
```
BMI < 18.5 → Underweight
18.5 - 24.9 → Normal
25.0 - 29.9 → Overweight (Class 0)
30.0 - 34.9 → Obesity Class I
35.0 - 39.9 → Obesity Class II
≥ 40.0 → Obesity Class III (Morbid)
```

### Provider Information (Static)
- **Provider**: Dr. Gavin Sigle
- **NPI**: 1497917561
- **License**: FL ME145797
- **Signature**: https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c49a9b_4dc4d9fce65f4c2a94047782401ffe9a~mv2.png

### Files to Modify

1. **Airtable Automation Script** - Add SOAP PDF generation after intake PDF
2. **IntakeQ Upload** - Second upload to different folder

### Success Criteria

- [ ] SOAP PDF generates with all patient data correctly placed
- [ ] Provider signature image renders in PDF
- [ ] PDF uploads to IntakeQ "SOAP NOTES" folder
- [ ] Styling matches intake form PDF
- [ ] Both PDFs attached to same patient profile

## Architecture Comparison

### V1 (Current Production)
```
src/app/intake/goals/page.tsx
src/app/intake/medication-preference/page.tsx
src/app/intake/research-done/page.tsx
... 60+ more files with some repeated patterns
```

### V2 (Future - Configuration-Driven)
```
src/config/forms/weightloss-intake.ts  # All steps defined here
src/app/v2/intake/[stepId]/page.tsx    # Single dynamic route
src/components/form-engine/FormStep.tsx # Single renderer
```

**V2 Benefits:**
- Add new steps by updating config only
- Consistent behavior across all steps
- Easy A/B testing
- Reduced code duplication
- Full type safety
